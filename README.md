# CodeBreaker Script
This is the original Python Script I used for CodeBreaker. I decided that the script was way too long for me to expand into a GUI, and I was too lazy to write a new file. I wanted native Windows UI and Python GUI doesn't have the best native UI. Thus, I turned this into a command with an option CLI, converted to EXE, and then utilized in WPF.
